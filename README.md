They do not have any in-house data science team, thus they have hired you as their consultant. 
Your job is to use your magical data science skills to provide them with suitable insights about their data and their customers.

The intend of the study is to find the underlying buying patterns of the customers of an automobile part manufacturers based 
on the past 3 years of the Company's transaction data and hence recommend customized marketing strategies for different segments of customers using RFM analysis.
